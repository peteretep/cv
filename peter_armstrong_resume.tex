\resheading{Engineering Projects}

\begin{description}
\item[Stability of Vessel for Launch and Recovery of Tidal Energy Device:] {I am currently working on my Masters project regarding the stability of operations and maintenance vessels.}

\item[CFD Analysis of a Tidal Turbine Blade:] {I modelled a section of a tidal turbine blade using ANSYS Fluent. I compared the results with results obtained from Blade Element Momentum analysis.}

\item[{\href{https://github.com/peteretep/measure-correlate-predict}Measure Correlate Predict for weather data}:] { I wrote a simple python script to analyse weather data as part of a wind energy assignment. I focused on clarity of code and documentation of methods when writing this script. The code is available on Github.}

\item[CFD Analysis of Microfluidic Mixing Devices:] { For this project I studied the microfluidics of mixing devices using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This involved modelling a number of designs using 3D CAD software and using the ANSYS CFX software package to analyse the behaviour of fluids flowing through them. This was my final year project for my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering. }
